# javascript-challenge
Created a basic HTML web page.

Used the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appended a table to the web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


Added a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.


Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the date/time column to find rows that matched user input.
